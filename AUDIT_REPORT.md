```
backend/
├── index.js           # Main server file
├── routes/            # API routes
├── middleware/        # Auth middleware
├── utils/             # Notion utilities
├── examples/          # Integration examples
└── test/              # Basic API tests
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a build process (Webpack/Vite) for optimization
- Create reusable components to reduce duplication
- Add a `public/` directory for static assets
- Implement proper environment-based configuration

1. **Navigation inconsistencies:**
   - Some pages link to `index.html`, others to `/UltraBlack/index.html`
   - Mobile menu implementation varies across pages
   - Cart functionality only partially implemented

2. **Placeholder content:**
   - Store page uses placeholder images
   - Gallery section has placeholder images
   - Social media links are non-functional (#)

3. **Missing integrations:**
   - Frontend doesn't use the backend API
   - Newsletter signup is not connected
   - Contact forms don't submit data

### Code Quality
- Inline JavaScript in HTML files (poor separation of concerns)

const applicationValidator = [
  body('name').trim().notEmpty().withMessage('Name is required'),
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('essay').isLength({ min: 100, max: 500 }),
  (req, res, next) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    next();
  }
];
```

## Website Audit Report

# Ultra Black Run Club - Website Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-05

## 1. Executive Summary

The Ultra Black Run Club website is a well-architected project with a robust backend and a modern frontend structure. The backend follows industry best practices for security, performance, and scalability. The frontend is set up for a modern development workflow. This audit identifies several key areas for improvement to ensure the website is fully secure, functional, and ready for production.

## 2. Backend Audit

### Strengths

- **Solid Foundation:** The use of Express.js, `dotenv` for environment configuration, and a clear, modular structure in `index.js` provides a strong and maintainable foundation.
- **Security-First Approach:** Essential security middleware, including `helmet` for header protection and `express-rate-limit` for preventing abuse, is correctly implemented and applied early in the request lifecycle.
- **Robust Caching Strategy:** The integration of Redis for caching Notion API responses is a critical performance feature that will significantly reduce latency and minimize reliance on the Notion API.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The application includes graceful shutdown procedures and detailed error-handling middleware, which are crucial for maintaining stability and simplifying diagnostics in a production environment.
- **Secure File Uploads:** The scholarship application route (`routes/applications.js`) uses `multer` with strict validation on file size, MIME type, and count, providing essential protection against malicious file uploads.

### Recommendations

1.  **Critical: Implement Persistent File Storage:** The application submission route handles file uploads to server memory but lacks the implementation to transfer these files to a persistent storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage). This is the highest-priority task to ensure application data is not lost.
2.  **High: Implement User and Admin Notifications:** The code contains `TODO` markers for sending confirmation emails to applicants and notifications to administrators. Implementing this is essential for a complete user experience and effective administrative workflow.
3.  **Medium: Strengthen Admin Endpoint Security:** The `/api/admin/refresh-cache` endpoint is protected by a static API key. For enhanced security, this should be upgraded to a more robust authentication mechanism, such as JWTs or a signed request system, especially if more admin functionalities are planned.
4.  **Low: Conduct Dependency Vulnerability Scan:** Run `npm audit` to identify and patch any known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies to mitigate potential security risks.

## 3. Frontend Audit

### Strengths

- **Modern Architecture:** The `frontend/src` directory structure suggests the use of a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte), which is ideal for building a dynamic, responsive, and maintainable user interface.
- **SEO and UX Basics:** The project includes standard assets like `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and favicons, which are important for search engine optimization and a polished user experience.

### Recommendations

1.  **High: Establish a Clear Build Process:** The frontend directory lacks a `package.json` file, making the build and dependency management process unclear. A formal build system (e.g., Vite, Webpack) should be configured to bundle, optimize, and prepare the frontend assets for production.
2.  **Medium: Ensure Full API Integration:** The frontend needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure it correctly communicates with all backend API endpoints. The CORS policy must be configured to allow requests from the production domain.

## 4. Conclusion

The website is in a strong position, but the recommendations outlined in this report should be addressed before deployment. The most critical action item is the implementation of a persistent file storage solution for the scholarship application uploads. By addressing these points, the Ultra Black Run Club website will be secure, reliable, and ready for a successful launch.
